# AllNGSscriptsFromBennabiEtAl2024

All scripts to reproduce NGS analysis in Bennabi et al. 2024 from raw data.

There is one directory per type of analysis ([BRBseq](./BRBseq) and [scRNAseq](./scRNAseq)). Each directory contains a README file and is independent.

The analyses involving both BRBseq and scRNAseq were put in the [combine_scRNAseq_RNAseq](./combine_scRNAseq_RNAseq) directory.

All outputs were centralized into the [output.files](./output.files) directory.

All panels present in the paper are symlinked in the [figures](./figures) directory.
